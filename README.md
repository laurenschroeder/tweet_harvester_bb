"Big Brother" is a CBS reality TV show about a group of houseguests secluded in a house together. Each week, they have to complete challenges in order to gain power to stay in the game or nominate two players to be evicted. Each week, one of these two players is evicted based on a house vote. 

Many players strategize to improve their odds of winning: they make alliances, build trust, and make deals. The TV show has a large fanbase, and fans spend a lot of time discussing who they think will win the game and what types of strategies different houseguests are using. 

The name "Big Brother" stems from the fact that there are cameras and microphones watching the players 24/7. American viewers can pay to access these video and audio feeds anytime during the duration of the show. I found a Twitter feed, JokersBBUpdates, where updates about what is happening in these feeds are updated every minute or so.

I decided to play Big Brother with the Big Brother updates and create a diagram to show what's going on in the Big Brother house. By analyzing the text content of the tweets, I created a chart that shows where all of the players are and who they're talking to.

I used Python and the Tweepy API to analyze the tweets and a Neo4J database to visualize these different events.
